# C-OPP
In the course I learned to work with classes and objects as well as basics of object-oriented modeling and building class hierarchies. I learned the basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Design patterns and the application of the SOLID principles.
